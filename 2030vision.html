    <h3>
        Saudi Vision 2030 (sometimes called Project 2030) is a government program launched by Saudi Arabia which aims to achieve the goal of increased diversification economically,
        socially, and culturally, in line with the vision of Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman. It was first announced on 25 April 2016 by the Saudi government.
    </h3>
    
    <h4>
        The vision is built around three primary themes: a vibrant society, a thriving economy, and an ambitious nation.
        In order to achieve a vibrant society, Saudi Arabia will focus on its people and the Islamic faith. 
        This will happen through a series of commitments, including:
        <ul>
            <li>Increasing the number of Umrah visitors from 8 million to 30 million annually.</li>
            <li>Establishing the largest Islamic museum in the world.</li>
            <li>Doubling the number of Saudi heritage sites registered with UNESCO.</li>
            <li>Promoting the growth of cultural and entertainment opportunities within the Kingdom.</li>
            <li>Encouraging healthy lifestyles.</li>
            <li>Developing Saudi cities so that three are recognized in the 100 top-ranked cities in the world.</li>
        </ul>
